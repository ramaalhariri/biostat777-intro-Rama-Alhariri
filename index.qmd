Hello! My name is Rama Alhariri. I am a PhD student at the Human Genetics and Genomics Program at Johns Hopkins University. I am Syrian-American, though I would not delimit myself to that cultural description as I have lived in and moved around lots of places between Kentucky, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, New York, Shanghai (only for a month) and Baltimore. Some things I like to do for fun involve snuggling with my cat (she is a cuddle bug), hiking, reading, exercising and hanging out with friends and meeting new people.
