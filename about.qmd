I am a third year PhD student in the Human Genetics and Genomics program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. As a scientist that grew up most of my life in the Middle East, specifically Dubai, in which I studied and lived with friends from countries all around the world, I have been instilled with a love for ensuring that the scientific work I carry out is inclusive of individuals from underrepresented and understudied backgrounds. While I have and continue to work primarily in the field of genetic epidemiology, I also have an interest in medical genetics as it relates to clinical Mendelian cases. My interest lies mainly in academia, but I also wish to devote time to science education and advocacy - particulary as it relates to capacity building and informed decision making for individuals from underrepresented groups, ensuring that we build partnerships with local communities who feel heard and represented in science.
